# Getting Started with Hardhat 3

<Callout type="tip">
  Hardhat 3 is production-ready and you can migrate today! We'll keep it in beta
  status as we work on missing features and stabilize it in the near future.
</Callout>

Hardhat is a flexible and extensible development environment for Ethereum software.  
It helps you write, test, debug, and deploy your smart contracts with ease — whether you're building a simple prototype or a complex production system.

This guide walks you through the installation of our recommended setup.  
Because most of Hardhat’s functionality comes from plugins, you’re free to customize or choose a completely different path.

## Installation

To get started with Hardhat 3, you’ll need **Node.js v22+** and a package manager (`npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`).

```bash
mkdir hardhat-example
cd hardhat-example
```
